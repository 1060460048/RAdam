# RAdam

We are in an early-release beta. Expect some adventures and rough edges.

Detailed readme is still in process. 

## How to use guidance:

1. Directly replace Adam with RAdam first without changing any settings (if Adam works with some setting, it's likely RAdam also works with that). it is worth mentioning that, if you are using Adam *with warmup*, try RAdam *with warmup* first (instead of RAdam *without warmup*). 
2. Further tune hyper-parameters for a better performance.
